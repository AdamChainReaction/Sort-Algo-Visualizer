# Sort-Algo-Visualizer
A sorting algorithm visualizer using the Raylib Library
Made for the fun of it and has **RGB** mode

**Currently contains the following algorithms :**
- Bubble
- Insertion
- Select
- Gnome
- Bogo
- Miracle

The source code can be modified to add more algorithms pretty easily. you just need to add your new algorithm class , imploment a 1 step function along with a reset and exposing the active index, then just register it and add it to the drop down menu in the main function and watch it do it's thing :D
